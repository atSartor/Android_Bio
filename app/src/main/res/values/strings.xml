    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Andrew Sartor.
    \n\n\tThis is my first app for Android programmed in Kotlin.
    I\'m using this app as a starting point to explore the features of Android Studio
    as well as gain some rudimentary experience in application development for the Android
    system. This endeavor was prompted by multiple openings for the Android development team
    of Line Corporation in their Kyoto office. As I explore Android programming and become a more
    experienced programmer in general, I hope to gain experience that will make me a more marketable
    programmer upon my graduation from the University of Alabama in December 2020. Additionally,
    I hope to fully explore what the Android system has to offer, as well as gain insights that
    will change my programming methodology by exploring different technologies.
    \n\n\tAs of today, July 7th, 2020, I have experience using Java, C, C++, Ruby, Rails, and now Kotlin
    as I continue to complete more of these programming tutorials for Android.\n\n</string>
